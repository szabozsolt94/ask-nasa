## ASK NASA!

React app using an open source NASA API. It always shows the latest " Astronomy Picture of the Day" but you can browse any photos from previous days as well by choosing a specific  date. I also created a gallery that shows the pictures in chronological order.

I created this app for practice during my studies. 

**I have removed my API KEY from the codebase so it is not going to show any pictures!**

You can get a key [here](https://api.nasa.gov/) in a second.
